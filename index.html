    <h1> Peruvian Soul by Emilia</h1>
    <p>My name is Emilia Frisancho. I was born in Peru but raised in Italy. Over the past year, I spent a lot of time back in Peru and developed a deep connection with my roots and culture.
This website was born from that experience. Through it, I hope to share a piece of Peruvian identity not only through traditional items and clothing, but also by offering everyday fashion and products inspired by both Peruvian and international styles.
I hope you enjoy exploring the stories, collections, and unique pieces Iâ€™ll be sharing and selling here.</p>
